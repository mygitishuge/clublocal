# eatlocal
I built this app using react native to illustrate my ability to make an api call and use the data received in a constructive manner.

The API in question is the Google Maps API, which I used to find restaurants near me. To do this I had to first get my device location, send this in the request to the API and then that returned all restaurants within the given radius (4000m). 

I used Expo library for getting the app up and running to test as quickly as possible.

I also added basic styling to make the interface easier to understand, below is a screenshot of the app being tested on my phone:
